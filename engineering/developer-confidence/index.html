<h2 id="title-confidence-and-the-software-engineer">title = &ldquo;Confidence and the software engineer&rdquo;</h2>

<p>Computers are state machines. Software engineers or humans are also state machines. For me confidence is the most important of those states for a software engineer. Just as a piece of software can end up in a bad &ldquo;state&rdquo; software developers can also be in a bad state when they lack confidence.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-confidence-in-the-context-of-software">What is confidence in the context of software?</h3>

<p>So what do I actually mean when I say lack confidence. Well lets define what confidence is in the context of software engineering and then we will understand better what the lack of it is. Confidence in software is made up of the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>understanding</li>
<li>proof</li>
<li>consensus</li>
</ul>

<p>So lets take a simple example. You have been asked to implement a feature that will allow administrators to find users of a business system within a certain distance so that they can be invited to local networking events.
How does understanding fit in here?
We must clearly understand requirements in order to have confidence that we can deliver what has been asked of us.
Taking the above feature, what happens when we get to implementing the distance? Well is it in miles, Kilometers or some other measurement? This is a contrived example, but shows how confusion and uncertainty can begin to creep in and if it creeps into your mind you can be sure it will creep into your code. This can manifest itself as code bloat and numerous similar apis.
We must also clearly understand the system we are going to implement this feature within or how can we have any confidence that we can deliver on time?
How does proof fit in?
There is only one way to reliably prove anything in software: Tests,test,tests repeatable and thorough tests. Anything else should be considered transient. Why well how will you know if it is still working? and how can you have any confidence in anything that is transient?<br />
Tests will help prove that the feature is complete and, just as importantly, they will prove that no one has broken your feature in the future. This builds not only your confidence, but also the confidence of other developer&rsquo;s as they work around and within existing code.
As a side note, for a great piece on what and how to test google has a great <a href="http://googletesting.blogspot.ie/2015/04/just-say-no-to-more-end-to-end-tests.html">testing blog post</a>
Finally we have consensus. It should be rare that you are working entirely alone on something bigger than a side project. Having peers involved means you can build consensus on solutions to problems and consensus always builds the confidence of those involved. If you make all the decisions yourself there is always the opportunity for doubt to creep in again. Also you can easily become consequence blind and sucked down implementation rabbit holes.</p>
